## Making a Phylogenetic Tree in R

Load the necessary packages 
```{r}
library(phytools)
library(geiger)
library(diversitree)
```

We are going to make a family level tree of 8 snake families!
```{r}
#put our snake families in the tree format and apply to variable Snakes
Snakes <- "((((((Elapidae,Lamprophiidae),Colubridae),Homalopsidae),Viperidae),(Pythonidae,Boidae)),Typhlopidae);"

#read the tree with the snake families
snake.tree<-read.tree(text=Snakes)

#plot the tree
plotTree(snake.tree, ftype = "b", fsize = 1.2, color = "green", lwd = 4)
```
